# Conference-Facility-Location-Project
The project aims to select an optimal location amongst the given options for a post-pandemic tax professionals' conference. The goal is to balance cost efficiency and logistical feasibility by minimizing overall costs, including travel, accommodation and lost client billable hours. Additionally, this project also looks at optimizing the number of rooms to be booked, taking into account the potential absence of some invitees to the conference. 

**Constrained Optimization** and **Economic Ordering Quantity (EOQ)** are the major methods used in solving this problem. A detailed explanation of the project is given in the report.
